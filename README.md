This is an android app which finds the best intermediate stations for splitting your train journey (Indian Railways). 
When reserved tickests are not available for single direct journey to your destination you can use this app to find other stations along the route to split your journey in two trains. In other words even though when you can not  find a ticket covering the entire journey you can travel to some other in between station covering half your journey and from there you can travel to your final destination by another train.

find this app in playstore.
